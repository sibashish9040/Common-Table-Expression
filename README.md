# ðŸ“˜ SQL Server CTE (Common Table Expressions) 

This repository demonstrates how to use **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** in SQL Server for recursive queries and hierarchical data analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ File

- `Common_table_exp.sql`: Contains multiple examples of using CTEs in SQL Server, including:
  - Aggregating customer sales
  - Retrieving the last order date per customer
  - Ranking customers based on total sales
  - Displaying hierarchical employee structures with recursion

## ðŸ§  What I have Learnt:

1. **What is a CTE?**
   - A temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

2. **Syntax Overview**
   ```sql
   WITH CTE_Name AS (
       -- Query definition
   )
   SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
